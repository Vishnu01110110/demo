Voice +Cchat Agent Experiment
Thiss project was me playing around seeing what people are doing in this space what is a minimum viable product i could come upp with and research what improvements and lmitations are there to explore in these pipelines.

Tech
ChatGPT API for most uses (Voice Assistant + Chat Assistant)
Whisper API for Speech-to-Text
TTS API for Text-to-Speech
Next js
Type Script
python to play around with and fine tune models

Current Models
Voice Model: Fine-tuned to extract ONLY phone number and name
Chat Assistant: LLM that looks, prioritizes, and assesses cases/seems

Just experimenting with different APIs to see how fast they were and how effective fine-tuning is.

Actual Motivation
Wanted to experiment with different RAG models and actually make something much cooler, but underestimated the complexity and started too late.
